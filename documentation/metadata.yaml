title: Engineering Simulator for Rocket Flight Analysis
abstract: A team from the Space Concordia association at Concordia University is entering a submission into the International Rocket Engineering Competition run by the Experimental Sounding Rocket Association (ESRA). To complement the team's mechanical design process, an Engineering Simulation is required to validate the flight performance criteria set by the competition. Matlab Simulink was used as an environment to model the flight dynamics and output the results. Thorough unit and integration testing was performed, in addition to comparison with experimental data to validate the model. Significant areas beyond the scope of the project are explored, such as a thorough stability analysis, preliminary considerations of a 6DOF simulator based on quaternion rotations, stochastic parameter variation to determine simulation uncertainties, and a generally in-depth review of literature and theory relating to high-powered rocket flight. The primary flight performance criteria of the CR_2-4G rocket was confirmed to comply with all competition requirements and suggests the rocket is on course to maximize the team scores for performance. Future considerations are recommended for improvement and extension of the simulator.
