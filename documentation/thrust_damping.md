## thrust damping coefficient
  
> Torque generated by "lateral acceleration of hot rocket gas as it travels down the motor tube"

$$ \tau_{da} = - \dot{M} (l^2_{cn}-l^2_{cc}) \omega $$

[Box et. al]
$\dot{M} (l^2_{cn}-l^2_{cc})$ is the thrust damping coefficient $C_{da}$ and must be passed to the model 

- not dimensionless, $\dfrac{kg \cdot m^2}{s}$
