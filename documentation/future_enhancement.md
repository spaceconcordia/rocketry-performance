## Project 2 - Stability (Roll, Pitch, Yaw) Analysis

### Overview
- non-linear model (stability analysis)
 - finding lift will be annoying

## Validation
- Unit Testing where applicable
- Comparison with OpenRocket data
- Comparison with previous models and Arcturus flight data
- Comparison with available flight data

## Out-of-scope
- ambient conditions
- range (drift)
- roll

## Project 3 - Onboard Execution (Extra)

Run the simulation on the commercial avionics hardware and actuate the recovery system.
