## Future Enhancements

### Embedded Execution

### 6DOF System with Quaternions

### Porting to Python / OpenModelica

### Robust Wind Model

### ThrustCurve.org API Integration

ThrustCurve.org has an API we could use to dynamically pull motor data for integration into the simulation

[ThrustCurve.org API]:(http://www.thrustcurve.org/searchapi.shtml)

### Logging
- it would be nice to enable logging - a master log file that output useful progress information during the simulation

### Other
- it would be nice to enable a countdown and mission status to show what stages are encountered
