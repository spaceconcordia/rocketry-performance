## Dynamic Parameters

### Thrust

Thrust curves are provided by the commercial manufacturer, and are handled as input by the *Data Model*.

### Weight 

As fuel is expended in generating thrust, weight of the rocket is reduced. The motor manufacturer provides a expenditure rate known as the *Specific Fuel Consumption*. This rate is considered constant. 

### Center of Mass
    - mass (changes with fuel expenditure)
    - center of mass (changes with fuel expenditure)
    - moments of inertia (changes with fuel expenditure)
    - thrust damping 
### Moments of Inertia
