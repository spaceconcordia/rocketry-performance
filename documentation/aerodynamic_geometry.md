## Aerodynamic Geometry

### Surface Roughness

*Surface Roughness* is the deviation in the normal direction from a surface of its features. It contributes to *Skin Friction Drag* 

### Fineness Ratio

The *Fineness Ratio* is the ratio of the length to the outer diameter

$$ f_B = L / OD $$ 

### Fins

### Aerodynamic Chord Length of Fins

Since there is no airfoil on the fin design, the *Aerodynamic Chord Length of the Fins* ($L_cf$) is equal to the height of the fins. 

### Areas

Reference areas are required to calculate the drag force.

Related to area, the specific parameters of interest on the rocket are the following:

- Outer Diameter of Rocket (*OD*)
- Total Length of Rocket (*L*) 
- Height of Nose Cone ($h_n$)
- Thickness of Fins
- Number of Fins
- Width of Fins
- Surface Area of Nose


#### Wetted Body Area

The *Wetted Body Area* is the combined area of all surfaces in contact with moving air.

#### Frontal Reference Area

The *Frontal Reference Area* is the projected area of the rocket perpendicular to the direction of air flow. For perfectly vertical flight and quiescent air conditions, this is the precise projection of the tip face of the rocket.
