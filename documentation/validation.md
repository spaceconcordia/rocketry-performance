# Validation

The engineering flight simulation was tested comprehensively.

## Unit Testing

It was ensured that individual Matlab functions provided the output expected, and that Simulink blocks employing the Matlab functions worked on a unit level - Reference Models were employed for this purpose

## Integration Testing

## System Testing

The simulator was tested on a system level by simulating the CR_2-4G rocket flight on all available simulators and comparing all possible results. 
These results are discussed in detail in the *Simulation Execution* section.
