## Static Parameters

Many rocket design parameters are considered to remain constant during flight.

These parameters are written in the parametric spreadsheet shared with the design team.
The CAD software populates values related to the structural design, and others are entered manually. 
The performance model reads them at the beginning of execution to simulate the latest design iteration.
