# Onboard Simulation

## Introduction

We would like to run the performance model on the avionics flight hardware to test the recovery systems, as well as to learn for future applications.

## Scope

- run the performance model on the flight hardware to simulate conditions for recovery
- the model will not be run during the rocket flight, only during recovery testing

## Requirements

- the Avionics Team must select a flight computer that will be able to handle the execution of a Matlab/Simulink simulation on top of its nominal flight duties
- a Data Management budget is first required to ensure that the selected components can process and deliver the avionics data at an acceptable frequency without any bottleneck

## Hardware Support

There may be hardware limitations to support running Simulink which restrict the choice of computer for avionics.
