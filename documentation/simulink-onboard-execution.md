# Onboard Simulation

## Introduction

We would like to run the performance model on the avionics flight hardware to test the recovery systems, as well as to learn for future applications.

## Scope

- run the performance model on the flight hardware to simulate conditions for recovery

## Hardware Support

There may be hardware limitations to support running Simulink which restrict the choice of computer for avionics.
