## Center of Pressure 
    - the point at which all aerodynamic forces can be considered to be acting
    - center of pressure moves with angle of attack
        - force on the nose cone, force on the body, force on the fins

## Center of Gravity 
> the balance point which a free-flying object rotates around. It is the pivot point for the three main forces acting on the rocket:
> thrust, air on nose, air on the fins

    - the location at which the weight due to mass can be considered concentrated at a point

## Thrust Damping
> Torque generated by "lateral acceleration of hot rocket gas as it travels down the motor tube"

$$ \tau_{da} = - \dot{M} (l^2_{cn}-l^2_{cc}) \omega $$
