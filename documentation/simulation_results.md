# Simulation Execution

## Simulation Configuration

For all tests, the following conditions were used, based on historical data for June 25th, 2015 at 12:00PM (noon) near Green River, Utah [@forecastio].

| Date       | Elevation          | Ground Pressure | Ground Temperature      | Wind Speed         | Humidity |
| ---        | ---                | ---             | ---                     | ---                | ---      |
| 2015/06/15 | 4,078 ft (1,243 m) | 101300 Pa       | 298.15 K (25 $^\circ$C) | 6 km/h (1.6 m/s)   | 33 %     |
| 2014/06/15 | 4,078 ft (1,243 m) | 100700 Pa       | 296.15 K (23 $^\circ$C) | 20 km/h (5.56 m/s) | 8 %      |
| 2013/06/15 | 4,078 ft (1,243 m) | 101000 Pa       | 299.15 K (26 $^\circ$C) | 10 km/h (2.78 m/s) | 19 %     |

### Best Case

The best case scenario is with no wind, and a 0$^\circ$ launch angle, and the lowest air pressure.

| Wind Speed | Ground Pressure | Ground Temperature      | Launch Guide Angle | Humidity |
| ---        | ---             | ---                     | ---                | --- |
| 0 m/s      | 101000 Pa       | 298.15 K (25 $^\circ$C) | 0$^\circ$          |  

\captionof{table}{Best Case Simulation Conditions}

### Worst Case

The worst case scenario, is the maximum wind condition permitted for launch by the competition, and a launch guide angle, and the highest pressure.

| Wind Speed | Ground Pressure | Ground Temperature      | Launch Guide Angle |
| ---        | ---             | ---                     | ---                |
| 8.33 m/s   | 101325 kPa      | 288.15 K (15 $^\circ$C) | 5$^\circ$         |
