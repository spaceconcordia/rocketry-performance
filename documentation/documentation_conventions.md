# Documentation Conventions

## Markdown 
Markdown is a markup language that is meant to be easy to read and easy to write, as well as easy to convert to HTML, LaTeX, PDF, and other output types.

## Python
Python is used to enable additional filters which handle features currently not supported out-of-the-box by Pandoc
