# Input Parameters

Before beginning the modeling process, it is necessary to understand the inputs of the system. 

Many parameters can be considered unchanging during flight, and are from this point referred to as *Static Parameters*. Other inputs change as a function of time or velocity, and must be carefully handled within the system - these parameters are herein referred to as *Dynamic Parameters*.
