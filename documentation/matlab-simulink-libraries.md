# Managing Matlab/Simulink Libraries

## Introduction
The goal is to create a robust Simulink model that references Matlab code from files that can be tracked by versioning software (Git). The Matlab source should be editable and effect changes in the Simulink model.

## Scope

## Creating a Library
1. Open Matlab
2. Open Simulink
3. Click File --> New --> Library

## Add to Library Browser
