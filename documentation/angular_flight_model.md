## Project 2 - Angular Flight Stability (Roll, Pitch, Yaw) Analysis

### Overview
- non-linear model (stability analysis)
 - finding lift will be annoying

> "One of the first principles any rocket designer must learn is that a rocket will fly only if the center of gravity is ahead of the center of pressure far enough to allow the air currents to cause a stabilizing effect."

### Validation
- Unit Testing where applicable
- Comparison with OpenRocket data
- Comparison with previous models and Arcturus flight data
- Comparison with available flight data

### Out-of-scope
- ambient conditions
- range (drift)
- roll
