# Statistical Analysis

A statistical analysis is needed to establish the confidence of our simulations.

## Pertinent Questions

## Scope

It would be interesting to generate a distribution of simulation data in which variability in parameters was evaluated to produce a large set of results for all data of interest

1. Tolerance analysis with Simulations to determine confidence limits of estimations (particularly altitude and velocity)
2. How much variation in C$_d$ and motor impulse is required to achieve the recorded altitude and velocity 
3. Compare the time to apogee of simulation data (Performance Model, OpenRocket, RASAero) to the time to apogee of Avionics data (Strattologger, custom avionics)
    - if the simulation time to apogee is not close to the actual flight time to apogee, something is wrong in the simulation
4. Find reliable 3rd party sources of data to increase the statistical accuracy of the model
    - Weather balloon data for real altitude data: http://weather.uwyo.edu/upperair/sounding.html

## Data of Interest

### Velocity vs. Time

### Mach Number vs. Time

### Acceleration vs. Time

### Drag Coefficient vs. Velocity

--- 

## Tolerance Analysis

### Tolerance Sources

#### Low Impact

##### Dimensional variation 

#### Medium Impact
 
##### Parasitic Drag

Any feature on the outer surface not accounted for in the CATIA design that introduces parasitic drag

- exposed nuts and bolts
- launch guide
- etc.

#### High Impact

##### Variation in Thrust

- Motor impulse can easily vary $\pm$ 10% 
- 20% variance is allowed under NFPA1120
