Have you done a tolerance analysis with your simulations to determine confidence limits of your altitude estimation?

How much variation in Cd and motor impulse would be required to achieve your recorded altitude?
Is this variation within the uncertainty of these values?
Have you simmed the flight with a more aerodynamically accurate simulation package such as RASAero?
You do know that motor impulse can easily vary +/-10% of the certification value and up to 20% variance is allowed under NFPA1120 correct?

Have you compared the time to apogee of your sim to the the time to apogee from the altimeter data?
You may suspect the pressure altitude calculation but the clock on the altimeter is almost certainly correct. If your sim time is not close to the actual flight time then your model (sim) is wrong.

Pressure reading can be reasonably accurate. If you want the best estimate of real altitude you can use balloon soundings.
